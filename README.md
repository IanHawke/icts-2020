# ICTS 2020, Numerical Hydrodynamics

Material for the (remote) [ICTS workshop on Gravitation Wave Astrophysics](https://www.icts.res.in/program/gws2020).

This repository contains handouts, reading lists, exercises and code examples for the *Numerical Hydrodynamics* section of the workshop.

The slides for the lectures can be [found online](http://ianhawke.github.io/slides).

## Use of coding exercises

Full solutions are provided in Python, as well as stub codes (to remove some of the tedium of setting up boilerplate code and simplifying plotting). To use this code you'll need to install the libraries

* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `matplotlib`
* `numba` (useful, not essential)

I recommend the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) if you don't already have this installed.
